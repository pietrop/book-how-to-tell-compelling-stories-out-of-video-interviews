# Why Paper-editing?

## What is a paper-edit?

Imagine you have one or mroe interviews and you want to craft a story out of it. More specificly in the form of a video sequence, if you are making a documentary.

Stop for a second, and think what would you do next? What would you process be to get there?

If you had experience with eidting of video interviews think about how you might have go about doing so in the past?


Some people would ingest the footage in a video editing software of choice, play the video, or scrub through the timeline to find interesting bits. Copy those onto the timeline. Cluster them by topics, perhaps adding a title above a certain section to group them togethere and find it easier to move between sections. Then they would rework the timeline decidign on a order and gradually, slowly, painfully get to a video sequence. By that point they are generally exausted and iteration or big variations from the current version are not a welcome sudgestion, because of the overheads they involve. Sounds familiar? 

In a paper-editing workflow, at a high level, you would do the following. 

1. You'd get a timecoded transcription of the video interviews
2. Read it through a first time
3. Read a second time, with a hilighter and mark things that stands out at a gut feeling level. 
4. Look through a third time to identify themes and ideas that could be group togethere, from the parts you have identified. 
4. Make a list of the themes you have identified in each interview.

5.  Think about how the themes relate to each other

6. Make an outline of these highl level themes, selecting the most significant.

7. Fill in the dialogue, find the text in the transcription for each theme in the outline, and add it to the outline.
Will come back to this point an thing about story concept that can be used to strengthen the narrative. Such as expositon.

8. Using the timecodes and file reference in the paper-edit reconnect the video sequence in the video editing software of choice.

In my experience another advantage of this process is that if you share the outline of your paper edit, or the paper-edit itself with other stake holders in the projects, eg if you are working with or for an exec or a producer, or a client etc.. and they ask you to do changes, you can use it as mean to discuss the overarching structure of the narrative. And generally if you get to a point where you agree on it. You will have fewer sudgestions for changes once you show an assembled sequence. As you are shortnening the feedback loop.
