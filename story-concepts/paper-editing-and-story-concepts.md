# Paper-editing  and story concepts

Now Let's revisit our paper-edit overview in relation to some story concepts that can help us along the way crafting a more compelling narrative. 

## Hands on option
If you like an hands on approach you can follow along provided transcriptions from the Whistle Blower Interview Archive, or your own material. Alternatively you can just read it and skip the hands on parts. 

### Your own material
If you want to use your own material, you can use [autoEdit.io](http://autoEdit.io) to generate a first draft of automated transcriptions. And export as a plain text time-coded transcription. See [autoEdit user manual](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/transcribing.html) and [last section for more on this](/digital-paper-editing/autoedit-2-digital-paper-editing-software.md). 

### Interviews from Whistleblower Interview Project
If you want to use interviews from the Whistle Blower Interview project.
 
You can print these pdf for a hands on approach

- [Thomas Drake Interview](/pdfs/AAA_TD.pdf)
- [Jesselyn Radack Internview](/pdfs/AAA_JR.pdf)
- [Annie Maclon Interview](/pdfs/AAA_AM.pdf)

You can also explore the corresponding interactive transcriptions project at [whistleblower.press](http://whistleblower.press).

For the purpose of learning the paper-edit process, we suggest to not watch the video, and just rely on the text transcription. If you need adjustment such as using text to speech, you can do so on the pdf version before printing. But we'd recomend doing the hilighting and the rest of the process on paper. 

Let me also re-iterate that on the other hand for day to day editing of video interviews we recommend using [autoEdit.io](http://autoEdit.io), as described in the [last section](/digital-paper-editing/autoedit-2-digital-paper-editing-software.md). 



## Paper-editing process

We'll give an overview of the paper-editing process. At appropriate stages will introduce relevant Story concepts. However to avoid cluttering this space, we link to the story concepts each in its separate section, so that they can also be easier to reference at a later stage. 

### 1. Timecoded Transcription
We already mentioned the importance of transcriptions as part of this abstraction process. this is where they come in.

### 2. Read
Read it through a first time

### 3. hilight what stands out
Read a second time, with a hilighter and mark things that stands out at a gut feeling level.

**Story concepts**: Terminology](/story-concepts/terminology.md)

### 4. Identify Themes and ideas
Look through a third time to identify themes and ideas that could be group together, from the parts you have identified.

**Story concepts**: 
- [3 levels of conflict](/story-concepts/levels-of-conflict.md)
- [The Gap](/story-concepts/the-gap.md)


### 4. list the themes
Make a list of the themes you have identified in each interview.

### 5. explore relations
Think about how the themes relate to each other

### 6. Make high level outline
Make an outline of these high level themes, selecting the most significant.

**Story Concepts**:
- [The Quest](/story-concepts/the-quest.md)
- [Three Act Structure](/story-concepts/three-act-structure.md)



### 7. Fill in the dialogue
Fill in the dialogue, find the text in the transcription for each theme in the outline, and add it to the outline.
Will come back to this point an thing about story concept that can be used to strengthen the narrative. Such as expositon.

### 8. Reconnect video sequence
Using the timecodes and file reference in the paper-edit reconnect the video sequence in the video editing software of choice.
