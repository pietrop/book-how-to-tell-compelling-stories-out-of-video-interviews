# Story Concepts: Terminology

<!-- TODO: find slides from LCC story press, and see images/diagrams associated with this -->

## Exposition 

>Exposition is the information that grounds you in a story: who, what, where, when, and why"  is about  "**giving away what the audience needs, when the audience needs it**.

We'll [discuss this in more detail in the exposition section](/story-concepts/exposition.md).


<!-- As McKee says every scene should lead to the next- check this -->


## Train / Narrative Spine
>“No film set on a train ever failed” 

![](/assets/early_films_trains.png)

The quote is an inside joke on the double meaning of the word **train**. That in story terminology stands as synonym for narrative spine, and how earlier films have often involved trains in some capacity. From top left: [Lumiere brothers "Train at La Ciotat"](https://youtu.be/1dgLEDdFddk), ["Night Mail Train"](https://youtu.be/-WO7JxYlhOM) produced by the GPO Film Unit,[ Dziga vertov "Man with the Movie Camera"](https://youtu.be/cGYZ5847FiI), "[Chronicle of a summer"  Edgar Morin and Jean Rouch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronique_d%27un_%C3%A9t%C3%A9).

>storytelling to** move forward **you want the audience to be curious about the information you’re giving them.
>
>your goal is to create a film that’s driven by a story, one that will motivate even general viewers to want to know more of those details that thrill you.




## Theme
>the general** underlying subject** of a specific story, a recurring idea that often illuminates an aspect of the human condition.

## Arc

>The arc refers to the way or ways in which the events of the story **transform your characters**

In an over simplification we could say that if a Character goes from `A` to `B`. That's some kind of a journey.

But if they Go from `A` to `C` going through `B`. Where in `B` they have some kind of transformation so that our character at `A` and our character at `C` are different, then you got a story ARC.
The difference could as small as change of mind of some view of the world and as big as a character transformation where they could almost be distinct as two different people.

## Plot and Character  

>A **character-driven** film is one in which the action of the film emerges from the wants and needs of the characters. 
>
>In a ** plot-driven film**, the characters are secondary to the events that make up the plot.

<!-- is this a quote? check Artistotele's poetics for screenwriters book

i.e. Thin Blue Line imitates a plot-driven: exploration of the casual encounter that leaves Randall Adams facing the death penalty. Circumstances act upon Adams; he doesn’t set the plot in motion except inadvertently, when his car breaks down and he accepts a ride from David Harris. In fact, part of the film’s power comes from Adams’s inability to alter events, even as it becomes apparent that Harris, not Adams, is likely to be the killer.-->
