# Story Concepts: Levels of conflict 

![3 Levels of conflict picture]()

>“A character's world can be imagined as a series of concentric circles surrounding a core of raw identity or awareness, circles that mark the levels of conflict in a character's life. The inner circle or level is his own self and conflicts arising from the elements of his nature: mind, body, emotion. “
