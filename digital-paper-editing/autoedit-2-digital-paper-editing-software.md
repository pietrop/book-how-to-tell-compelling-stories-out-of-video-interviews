# autoEdit 2: Digital Paper-editing software 

Paper-editing is tedious and time consuming. But none the less it still remains the most effective way to craft a compelling story out of video interviews. 

In the last couple of years I've been working on [autoEdit2](http://www.autoedit.io/) a fast text based video editing that makes it easier, faster and more accessible to edit video interviews by leveraging the power of automated transcriptions.

In the analogue workflow the biggest bottle necks are in the transcription stage, and the assembling of the video sequence stage. 

A digital solution removes these blockers and the cognitive overload associated with it, freeing the producer con focus on the story.
