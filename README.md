# How to tell compelling stories out of video interviews

## _The Art and craft of documentary paper-editing._

Book is inspired by a series of [hands on workshops "How to craft compelling stories out of video interviews?"](http://pietropassarelli.com/wip_london_july2016.html) given in 2016 in London, NY, Hacks/Hackers Media Party in Buenos Aires, SRCCON in Portland, and MozzFest in London.

This was in collaboration with Niels Ladefoged who has been curating the Whistle Blower Interview Project in collaboration with the centre for investigative journalism in London.

This was the original description of the workshop. 

>Using some of the videos from the Whistle Blowers Interview Archive, weâ€™ll take an hands on approach to explore key concepts, ideas and techniques to identify narrative points, test out story ideas, and craft a compelling story.

>This workshop focusses on the underlying evergreen storytelling principles that transcend the medium, so no knowledge of video editing required, just curiosity towards story telling principles and techniques.

>Participants will be divided into groups of 3 to 4 people. The aim for each group is to produce a 3 to 5 minutes video, given 3 short video interviews (roughly 15 min each) accompanied by their corresponding time-coded transcriptions.

>Key story telling principles and techniques will be introduced to facilitate the process.
The aim of the workshop is for the participants to gain an hands on insight into the process of interviewed based documentary story crafting rather then producing a polished final product.

In this book we refer to documentary production as out primary use case, but much of these lessons can be applied to any type of interview  based medium, such as radio, podcasts or news production.

The book is divided into 3 main parts, first part is on paper-editing, explains what it is, and why should you bother. Second part revisits the paper-editing process and introduces story concepts to help crafting more compelling narratives along the way. 
Last but not least in the third section we introduce autoEdit2 a digital-paper-editing software that can be used as an off the shelf solution. 


**In the first part** we start with an overview of documentary production explaining where paper-editing fits in the process.
